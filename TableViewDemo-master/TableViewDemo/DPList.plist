		<string>It&apos;s actually really interesting to me. It&apos;s sort of based on the research that&apos;s sort of happening now, about the fact that your genes might be able to hold memory. And you could argue semantics and say it&apos;s instinct, but how does a baby bird know to eat a worm, as opposed to a cockroach, if its parents don&apos;t show it? And it&apos;s about this science company trying to, Matrix-style, go into people&apos;s brains and find out an ancestor who used to be an assassin, and sort of locate who that person is.—Kristen Bell</string>

		<string>After completing Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Patrice Désilets was instructed to begin work on the next Prince of Persia game. The game began work under the title &quot;Prince of Persia: Assassin&quot;, inspired by the life of Hassan-i Sabbah.[8] Désilets felt a prince was not an interesting protagonist, so the game&apos;s titular prince was AI-controlled, and needed to be rescued by a player-controlled Assassin. Ubisoft did not want a Prince of Persia game that was not centered on the prince; the game was spun-off into a new IP, and the prince character was dropped.[8]</string>

		<string>The player&apos;s health is described as the level of &quot;Synchronization&quot; between Desmond and Altaïr&apos;s memories; should Altaïr suffer injury, it is represented as deviation from the actual events of the memory, rather than physical damage. If all synchronization is lost, the current memory that Desmond is experiencing will be restarted at the last checkpoint. When the synchronization bar is full, the player has the additional option to use &quot;Eagle Vision&quot;, which allows the computer-rendered memory to highlight all visible characters in colors corresponding to whether they are ally (blue), foe (red) or even the target of their assassination (gold). Due to Altaïr&apos;s memories being rendered by the computer of the Animus project, the player may experience &quot;glitches&quot; in the rendering of the historical world, which may help the player to identify targets, or can be used to alter the viewpoint during in-game scripted scenes should the player react fast enough when they appear.</string>

		<string>The player is made aware of how noticeable Altaïr is to enemy guards as well as the current state of alert in the local area via the &quot;Social Status Icon&quot;. To perform many of the assassinations and other tasks, the player must consider the use of commands distinguished by its type of profile. Low-profile commands allow Altaïr to: blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or other non-threatening tasks that can be used to hide and reduce the alertness level; the player can also use Altaïr&apos;s retractable blade to attempt low-profile assassinations. High-profile commands are more noticeable, and include: running, scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points, and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may raise the local area&apos;s awareness level. Once the area is at high alert, the crowds run and scatter while guards attempt to chase and bring down Altaïr; to reduce the alert level, the player must control Altaïr as to break the guards&apos; line of sight and then find a hiding space, such as a haystack or rooftop garden; or blend in with the citizens sitting on benches or wandering scholars. Should the player be unable to escape the guards, they can fight back using swordplay maneuvers.</string>

		<string>Assassin&apos;s Creed is an action-adventure video game in which the player primarily assumes the role of Altaïr, as experienced by protagonist Desmond Miles. The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood&apos;s headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities—Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus—to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional &quot;recon&quot; missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include: eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing and completing tasks for informers and fellow assassins. Additionally, the player may take part in any number of side objectives in these open world environments, including climbing tall towers to map out the city, and saving citizens who are being threatened or harassed by the city guards. There are also various side quests that do not advance the plot such as hunting down and killing Templars and flag collecting. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.</string>

		<string>At this point, Desmond is brought out of the Animus, his purpose served. He comes to learn that Abstergo is a front for the modern-day Templars. Abstergo is now set to use the locations on the map seen by Altaïr to find more Pieces of Eden, believing that they must collect the artifacts to control the world&apos;s population in order to stave off the projected end of the world in 2012. Desmond&apos;s life is spared by Lucy Stillman, an Assassin mole doubling as an Abstergo scientist. Left alone in his locked room, Desmond discovers (through &quot;the Bleeding Effect&quot; from his time spent in the Animus) that he can observe numerous messages in blood on the walls and floor left by a previous test subject (Subject 16) that foretell the end of the world.</string>

		<string>As Altaïr completes the assassinations, he finds that each was a member of the Templars searching the area for &quot;Pieces of Eden&quot;, artifacts similar to the one de Sablé attempted to steal. Upon encountering a heavily guarded de Sablé, he discovers that it was actually Maria, de Sablé&apos;s steward, disguised in his armor. She demands he finish the assassination, but he spares her. Altaïr learns the location of de Sablé, encounters him in front of King Richard and accuses him of Templar treason. King Richard makes the two fight and lets God decide who is telling the truth. Altaïr eventually kills de Sablé, who with his dying breath, reveals the existence of a tenth Templar: Al Mualim. Returning to the Brotherhood, Altaïr finds Al Mualim in possession of the Apple of Eden that is able to control people&apos;s minds. Altaïr is forced to fight his way through innocents and assassins under Al Mualim&apos;s control (with the help of other Assassins still loyal to the creed) to reach Al Mualim, and engages him in battle. Altaïr eventually sees through Al Mualim&apos;s tricks using the artifact, and kills him. Upon approaching the artifact, Altaïr is surprised to find it displays a projection of the Earth marking several spots around the globe.</string>

		<string>Desmond Miles, a bartender, is kidnapped by Abstergo Industries. There, Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is able to replay the genetic memories of the user&apos;s ancestors. In Desmond&apos;s case, they seek information about his ancestor Altaïr Ibn-La&apos;Ahad, an Assassin during the time of the Third Crusade. Within the Animus, Altaïr&apos;s memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sablé from taking an artifact from a temple, but broke all three of the Assassin Brotherhood&apos;s tenets in the process. The Brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Altaïr to the rank of Novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status.</string>
